This is an alternative router for Angular 2 focused on providing a simple, reactive API built to scale for large applications.

Please note that we are currently pre-v1.0. While we believe the core of the router is solid, you can expect a few breaking changes as we work towards a beta release. These early releases are meant to gather feedback from the community and to help with the direction of the router.

### Benefits / difference between component and ngrx router

The main differences between the component router and ngrx/router are the decisions behind the design. 

- The component router takes a more internal approach when it comes to components if you look at the lifecycle hooks. Ngrx router doesnâ€™t require that the router hook into your components so **any component is routable**. 
- Another difference is the **use of observables**. The component router uses promises to handle its lifecycle, whereas ngrx uses observables because they lend themselves to **more of a reactive approach**. 
- Ngrx's route/query parameters are observable which makes reusing components when parameters change easier. 
- Ngrx router has more streams available for you to subscribe to and react upon. 

The overall idea is that the browser URL itself is a stream and we are turning that stream into a view of rendered routes. Both routers have a concept of lazy loading, protecting routes, resolving data and lifecycle events. If you prefer a more observable approach, ngrx router works very nicely with that.

### Installation
Install @ngrx/router into your Angular 2 project via npm:

```
npm install @ngrx/router --save
```

### Routing Setup

1. Create your application components:

  ```ts
  import { Component } from 'angular2/core';

  @Component({
    selector: 'app',
    template: `
      <h1>My Blog</h1>
      <nav>
        <a linkTo="/">Home</a>
        <a linkTo="/blog">Blog</a>
      </nav>

      <route-view></route-view>
    `
  })
  class App { }

  @Component({
    selector: 'home-page',
    template: `
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
    `
  })
  class HomePage { }

  @Component({
    selector: 'blog-page',
    template: `
      <h2>Blog</h2>
      <nav>
        <a *ngFor="let post of posts" [linkTo]="'/blog/' + post.id">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </nav>

      <route-view></route-view>
    `
  })
  class BlogPage { }

  @Component({
    selector: 'post-page',
    template: `
      <h3>Post</h3>
    `
  })
  class PostPage { }
  ```
2. Configure your application routes:

  ```ts
  import { Routes } from '@ngrx/router';

  const routes: Routes = [
    {
      path: '/',
      component: HomePage
    },
    {
      path: '/blog',
      component: BlogPage,
      children: [
        {
          path: ':id',
          component: PostPage
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

3. Register router in application bootstrap.

  ```ts
  import { provideRouter } from '@ngrx/router';

  bootstrap(App, [
    provideRouter(routes)
  ]);
  ```

That's it! You are ready to begin taking advantage of reactive routing!
